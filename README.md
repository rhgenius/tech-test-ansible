# Fully automated Ansible Playbook to host a Wordpress site in an EC2

## Description

This is a fully automated Ansible Playbook to setup a Wordpress website from scratch. This playbook will launch an EC2 instance with a keypair and a secuirty group with required rules and then install the latest Wordpress website for you.


## Prerequisites

- Install Ansible in Ansible Master server. [Click here for Ansible Installation steps](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
- Attach IAM EC2 role to the Ansible master instance. (You can also use AWS access_key and secret_key to connect to AWS. In this case, you have to specify *access_key* and *secret_key* in your playbook)

 ## Features of this Playbook
 - While setting up the EC2 instance, the Playbook prompt you to enter ***AWS region, instance type, instance AMI id, your project name*** and ***name of SSH key***.
 - While installing Wordpress website, the Playbook prompt you to enter **domain name, new root password for mysql, name for your wordpress database** and ***database user name***
 - AWS IAM EC2 role is used instead of *secret_key* and *access_key* to connect to the AWS
 - This main.yml file actually contains 2 paybooks; one for launching the instance in AWS and one for installing and setting up Wordpress.

 ## Tasks defined in the Playbook
 
>Below tasks will generate an SSH keypair and copy private key(pem) to the working directory of Ansible master

```python
    - name: "SSH keypair creation. Keyname is {{key_name}}"
      ec2_key:
        region: "{{region}}"
        name: "{{key_name}}"
        state: present
      register: "key_info"

    - name: "copy private key to local server"
      when: key_info.changed == true
      copy:
        content: "{{key_info.key.private_key}}"
        dest: "./{{key_name}}.pem"
        mode: "0400"
```
 >Below task will create a Security Group with ports 80,443,22 and 3306 opened

```python
    - name: "Create Security group"
      ec2_group:
        region: "{{region}}"
        name: "{{project_name}}-sg"
        description: "secuirty group for devops instance"
        tags:
          Name: "{{project_name}}-sg"          
        rules:
          - proto: tcp
            ports:
              - 80
              - 443
              - 22
              - 3306
            cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0
            cidr_ipv6: ::/0
            rule_desc: "allow all on ports 80, 443, 3306 and 22"
        rules_egress:
          - proto: -1
            ports: -1
            cidr_ip: 0.0.0.0/0
            cidr_ipv6: ::/0
      register: "sg_info"

```
>Below task will launch an EC2 instance of the submitted type using the submitted AMI id. The instance will use above created SSH key and Security Group. 

```python
    - name: "Create EC2"
      ec2:
        region: "{{region}}"
        key_name: "{{key_info.key.name}}"
